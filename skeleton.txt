Goals:
    Get each Test Resources URL for Micro and Macro Units
    From each above URL, get each AP Question Bank URL (and others desired)
        -Unit 6 Micro Tax Questions? (skipping)
            -http://bencullivan.com/APEcon/taxes.htm
        -Unit 1 Macro is APUSH? (skipping)
    
    From each above URL, save all questions and answers (somehow?)
        -should be done in a way that it can be inputted into Google Forms
        -that will be really hard, the hardest part of this project b/c
            currently no Google support for importing question data into Forms
    
        Downloaded all URLs and image resources locally as HTML files
        Parsed HTML files to extract relevant information into JSON files
    
    Figure out how to port from JSON with all relevant information into Forms
    Secondary goal: convert JSON to CSV so CSV can be used in Google Sheets if need be
        -NO LONGER USEFUL GOAL

Progress:
    Gotten each Test Resources URL
    Gotten each AP Question Bank URL
    
    Downloaded every single test bank onto computer as HTML w/ answers
        -in the view where all answers are shown after submitting
        -decompose HTML into usable quiz format (JSON)
    
    Uploaded JSON versions of test banks to Google Drive
    
    Wrote function to port JSON format directly into Google Forms
    
    Iterated over every JSON file uploaded to create every Google Form
    
        
Parsing HTML Thinking:
